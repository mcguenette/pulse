## Pulse: Where Your Career Finds Its Rhythm
Welcome to Pulse, a web application created by students to provide a platform for connecting, collaborating, and thriving in your career journey. Pulse mimics the functionality of popular social media platforms like LinkedIn, offering a login page and a feed where users can post updates, upload images, and discover potential connections.

###Getting Started
To get started with Pulse, follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/mcguenette/pulse.git
cd pulse

###Navigate to the project directory:
Open the login.html file in your web browser to access the login page:

###Features
####Login Page
*The login page allows users to enter their credentials to access the Pulse platform.
*Please note that the login functionality is not fully functional in this frontend-only version. We have hardcoded an email and password for demonstration purposes.

####Feed Page
*After logging in, users are directed to the feed page where they can:
*Post updates and share content.
*Upload images to enhance their posts.
*View a list of random people as potential connections to follow.
*Interact with posts and connections.
